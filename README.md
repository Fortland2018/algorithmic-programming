# Algos
My own saved solutions to algorithmic problems

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized into the following categories:

- **[dynamic-programming](./dynamic-programming)** — Dynamic programming problems and techniques (memoization, tabulation, LCS, subset partition, subsequence queries)
- **[graph-algorithms](./graph-algorithms)** — Graph problems: DFS, topological sort, Dijkstra, path finding, prefix/suffix influence
- **[tree-algorithms](./tree-algorithms)** — Tree problems: subtree size accumulation, tree DP with subtree products
- **[greedy-and-data-structures](./greedy-and-data-structures)** — Greedy algorithms and data structures: segment trees, monotonic stack, quicksort, Tower of Hanoi, priority-queue matching
- **[systems-architecture](./systems-architecture)** — Low-level systems: x86-64 GShare branch predictor in assembly with a C++ driver

Each folder contains a README with descriptions of every program it contains.

## LeetCode Problems

LeetCode solutions are organised in the **[LeetCode](./LeetCode)** folder, with the following topic subfolders:

- **[LeetCode/Arrays-and-Strings](./LeetCode/Arrays-and-Strings)** — Array and string manipulation
- **[LeetCode/Trees-and-Graphs](./LeetCode/Trees-and-Graphs)** — Tree and graph data structures
- **[LeetCode/Dynamic-Programming](./LeetCode/Dynamic-Programming)** — Dynamic programming
- **[LeetCode/Sorting-and-Searching](./LeetCode/Sorting-and-Searching)** — Sorting and searching
- **[LeetCode/Math-and-Logic](./LeetCode/Math-and-Logic)** — Mathematical and logical problems
- **[LeetCode/Linked-Lists](./LeetCode/Linked-Lists)** — Linked list problems
- **[LeetCode/Backtracking](./LeetCode/Backtracking)** — Backtracking and recursion
- **[LeetCode/Two-Pointers](./LeetCode/Two-Pointers)** — Two-pointer technique problems
