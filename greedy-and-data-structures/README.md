# Greedy and Data Structures

Problems involving greedy algorithms and fundamental data structures (heaps, stacks, segment trees, etc.).

## Problems

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `def_stack.cpp` | Cycle detection in an undirected graph: counts connected components that form simple cycles, using DFS. |
| `monotonic_skyline_stack.cpp` | Counts the number of distinct visible building heights in a skyline using a monotonic stack. |
| `interactive_segment_tree.cpp` | Interactive segment tree supporting point updates and range-sum queries, with a step-by-step menu. |
| `lomuto_quicksort_iterative.cpp` | Lomuto-partition quicksort on an integer array (recursive implementation). |
| `tower_of_hanoi.cpp` | Tower of Hanoi solver with stack-based visualisation of disc positions after each move. |
| `bulb_matching_priority_queue.cpp` | Greedy bulb-to-socket matching: given two sorted lists of temperatures and k replacement budget, minimises total heat output. |
| `warm_taps_average_greedy.cpp` | Greedy algorithm that turns off the coldest taps one-by-one until the average temperature meets the minimum threshold. |
