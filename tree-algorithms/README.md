# Tree Algorithms

Problems involving tree data structures and algorithms (traversals, subtree DP, etc.).

## Problems

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `subtree_size_accumulator.cpp` | Computes the size of every subtree in a rooted tree using DFS and accumulating child sizes. |
| `tree_dp_subtree_products.cpp` | Tree DP that counts the number of distinct non-empty subsets of children for each node and multiplies these counts across the entire tree (mod 10^9+7). |
