# Graph Algorithms

Problems involving graph data structures and algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest path, topological sort, etc.).

## Problems

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `depth_first_search.cpp` | DFS traversal and cycle-detection on a directed graph using both iterative and recursive approaches. |
| `graph_paths.cpp` | Finds the longest path length in a directed graph by propagating path strings along edges. |
| `topological_sort_dag.cpp` | Topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using a recursive DFS and a finish-order stack. |
| `city_road_influence_prefix_suffix.cpp` | Computes per-city influence scores using a prefix pass and a suffix pass over a road network encoded as direction flags. |
| `multi_layer_dijkstra_trade.cpp` | Multi-layer Dijkstra for a trade/transport network where metals can be converted along edges with associated costs. |
| `street_crossing_map_balance.cpp` | Counts balanced street crossings between two groups of pedestrians using a frequency map. |
